## Introduction
----------------
*"No matter where you are, the skills and requirements for a penetration tester will be the same. You’ll be required to have a good understanding of various aspects within information security including web applications, networks and sometimes even low level technology like assembly. A good understanding of these technologies is essential to learning how to exploit them.*

*The aim of this path is to make you ready for real world penetration testing by teaching you how to use industry standard tools along with a methodology to find vulnerabilities in machines. By the time you complete this path, you will be well prepared for interviews and jobs as a penetration tester. To complete this path you should have a basic to medium understanding of computing.*  

*You can use this pathway to help you acquire the skills needed to go and get certified by well known certifiers in the security industry."*
